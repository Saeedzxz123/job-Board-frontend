## 🧩 App Name
**Job Board**

---

## 📖 Description
Job Board is a modern web application that connects job seekers with recruiters in a simple and intuitive way.  
Candidates can browse available jobs, apply by uploading their CV, and track their applications.  
Recruiters (HR users) can create, edit, and manage job postings, as well as view applicants for each job.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a full-stack workflow with authentication, role-based access, and a clean, professional user interface.

---

## 🎯 Background
Finding and managing job applications can be confusing for both applicants and recruiters.  
This app was built to simplify that process by providing:
- A clear job listing experience
- A simple application flow
- Separate experiences for HR users and candidates

The UI was designed to feel modern, clean, and easy to use.
